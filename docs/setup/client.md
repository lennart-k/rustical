### Authentication

Authenticate with HTTP Basic authentication using your user id and a generated app token.

## `/caldav` vs `/caldav-compat` (relevant for group sharing)

To discover shared calendars the `calendar-home-set` property is used to list all principals the user has access to.
However, some clients don't support `calendar-home-set` containing multiple paths (e.g. Apple Calendar).

As a workaround `/caldav-compat` offers the same endpoints as `/caldav` with the only difference being that it does not return all calendar homes in `calendar-home-set`.
This means that clients under this path will probably not auto-discover group calendars so you can instead add them one-by-one using the principal path `/caldav-compat/principal/<principal_id>`.

## DAVx5

You can set up DAVx5 through the Nextcloud login flow. Collections including group collections will automatically be discovered.

## Apple Calendar

You can download a configuration profile from the frontend in the app token section.

**Note**: Since Apple Calendar does not properly support the `calendar-home-set` property the `/caldav-compat` endpoints should be used.
That also means that Apple Calendar is not able to automatically discover group collections so in that case you'll have to manually add all principals with `/caldav-compat/principal/<principal_id>`.

## Evolution

Set up a collection account in the account settings.
Evolution correctly uses all calendar homes so group collections work properly.

## Home Assistant CalDAV integration

The underlying library `python-caldav` does not support multiple calendar homes so you should use the `/caldav-compat` endpoints.

As URL specify

```
https://<your-host>/caldav-compat
```

For group collections explicitly specify

```
https://<your-host>/caldav-compat/principal/<principal>
```
